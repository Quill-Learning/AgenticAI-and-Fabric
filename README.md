## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

- How **Agentic AI** patterns (planning, tool‑use, memory) map to practical, data‑centric workflows.
- How **Microsoft Fabric** data agents ground LLM outputs in enterprise data (Lakehouse, Warehouse, Power BI semantic models, KQL). [2](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empowering-agentic-ai-by-integrating-fabric-with-azure-ai-foundry/)

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- **Access to GitHub** (to view and run lab Markdown).
- **Microsoft Fabric (optional but recommended):**
  - Ability to create or access a **Lakehouse** and/or **Warehouse**.
  - **Power BI** workspace access for semantic models and reporting.
  - If extending labs with conversational agents, familiarity with **Azure AI Foundry** or GitHub Models per Microsoft guidance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open a lab**
   - Start with [Lab 001](https://github.com/Quill-Learning/AgenticAI-and-Fabric) and follow the steps.
2. **Use the images**
   - When the lab references screenshots, locate `image-*.png` in the repo. [1](https://github.com/Quill-Learning/AgenticAI-and-Fabric)
3. **(Optional) Run in Fabric**
   - If the lab includes SQL/KQL/DAX snippets or agent instructions, run them in your **Fabric workspace** (Lakehouse/SQL Endpoint, KQL DB, Power BI model). [2](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empowering-agentic-ai-by-integrating-fabric-with-azure-ai-foundry/)

---

## 🧭 Suggested Flow

- **Lab 001** → foundational setup and core agentic workflow concepts.
- **Lab 002** → refined scenarios, adding grounding across structured and semantic data and iterating on tool‑use. [2](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empowering-agentic-ai-by-integrating-fabric-with-azure-ai-foundry/)

---

## 🧩 Extending the Labs

- Explore Microsoft’s **AI Agents for Beginners** course for complementary patterns (tool‑use, RAG, multi‑agent, production). [3](https://microsoft.github.io/ai-agents-for-beginners/)
- Try Fabric’s **data agents** to orchestrate SQL/KQL/DAX generation over OneLake for more robust, grounded outputs. [2](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empowering-agentic-ai-by-integrating-fabric-with-azure-ai-foundry/)
